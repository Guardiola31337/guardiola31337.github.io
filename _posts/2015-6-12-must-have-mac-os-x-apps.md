title: Must-have Mac OS X Apps
summary: A great set of apps for Mac OS X.
---

I'm a Mac user for around 3 years, so I consider myself a relatively new user.
I remember well the first days and weeks and I was a bit lost in what apps could be useful for me on a daily basis.

I missed an article or a post from the point of view of a developer or a group of software engineers.
I went on the Internet but all I found were hundreds of sites with similar banal content, with titles like _"Best Mac OS X Apps"_ or _"Top 10 Mac Apps"_ but separated in categories, so it was really difficult to extract something helpful from them. I asked my colleagues and tried lots of apps in order to have a preferable suite nowadays.

A couple of months ago, a friend of mine became a new Mac user and he asked me the same question I did myself years ago:

> "What handy apps do you think I must have?"

Because of that, I did a small poll with a bunch of developers who work with Apple's operating system and I would like to share the results with you.

### Alfred

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) is a productivity application for Mac OS X, which aims to save you time in searching your local computer and the web.

Using a keyboard shortcut chosen by the user, Alfred provides a quick way to find and launch applications and files on the Mac or to search the web both with predefined keywords for often-used sites, with the ability to add users' custom searches for the sites most applicable to them. In its free version it also serves as a calculator, spell-checker and a convenient interface for controlling the Mac with system commands.

It's a vitamin-rich Spotlight.

_I'm addicted to the 'Empty trash' shortcut._

### XtraFinder

[XtraFinder](https://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) add Tabs and features to Mac Finder.

XtraFinder adds a series of handy little tweaks to Finder to make it easier to use. It adds browser-like tabs, as well as keyboard shortcuts, a dual pane mode for easy copying, among other functionalities.

### Dash

[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) gives your Mac instant offline access to 150+ API documentation sets.

Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 150+ APIs. You can even generate your own docsets or request docsets to be included.

### Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

Sublime Text natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.

### Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is hackable text editor for the 21st Century.

Atom is built on [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) by the GitHubâ€™s octocat army. It's based on everything they love about other editors. Atom is designed to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

_What I personally love about Atom is that it has Markdown support._

### iTerm 2

[iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a terminal emulator for Mac OS X that does amazing things.

iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It brings the terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted.

_When searching, it highlights all found words. That's awesome!_

What do you think? Are you using all of them? Some? Do you even know them? Do you have other good ones installed?

I would love to hear your thoughts. Let's all debate!
I'm pretty sure we will all learn from this discussion, so feel free to leave a comment :D

P.S. This isn't about the endless OS battle Linux vs Mac OS X vs Windows. This topic deserves a separate post.
