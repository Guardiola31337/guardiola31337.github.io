Hey there!

It’s been a long time since I started wondering about writing a blog and I figure it’s the right moment to do so. You might be asking yourself: Why?
What does motivate me to start this new experience?

The main reason is that I want to follow [Sandro Mancuso](https://twitter.com/sandromancuso)’s advice written in his awesome [book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism/dp/0134052501):
(If you haven't read it yet, I don’t know what you are waiting for…)

> “All software developers should have their own blogs regardless of how much experience they have.”

I completely agree with him and I want to share my thoughts and what I’m currently learning, as well as use it as a logbook of my progress.
Hopefully, it will be useful to others.

The other simple reason to start posting is because I spend a lot of time surfing through other people’s websites, reading their timelines and the valuable info that they share, so I think it’s time for me to give my five cents to the community.

I would like to use it as a channel of discussion, so please, leave your comments freely.

As a [friend of mine](https://twitter.com/flipper83) said in his last talk:

> “A good programmer is not afraid of asking questions nor explaining his point of view when asked.”

So, I’m looking forward to hearing from you.
