I'm a Software Engineer, lover of new technologies, passionate about challenges and motivated to continue learning current coding languages and methodologies. I'm a regular attendee at developersâ€™ events and meetings. I'm a Testing-lover and I try to share my knowledge collaborating [@AprendiendoTDD](https://twitter.com/AprendiendoTDD), [@theEvnt](https://twitter.com/theEvnt) and [@devscola](https://twitter.com/devscola) facilitating coding dojos and katas.
